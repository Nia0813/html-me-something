    <p> Can what we eat really make a difference? Can food really be healing? Is this 
        scientific or just another theory that someone made up? Below are some foods that have an 
        abunance of nutrition and may be able to fight off diseases. Keep reading and well, you decide!</p>
        <br>
        <br>

    <p> The foods we will be discussing are some you probably eat on a daily basis. Even during 
        biblical days people used food as part of the healing process. In 2 Kings 20:7 the Bible reads 
        "And Isaiah said, 'Bring a cake of figs. And let them take and lay it on the boil, that he may 
        recover.'" </p>

            kids favorites and is the second most popular fruit in the world!! They are super easy to grab and 
            go but hey did you know, the banana is actually a herb!! Well, since we have always known them as a
            fruit and I think they are superb I will just think of bananas as a ferb! The potential benefits
            of this wonderful ferb are, lowering blood pressure , supporting heart health, and reducing the 
            risk of developing childhood leukemia.</p>

            contains high amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. These small green trees can potentially help 
            prevent osteoarthritis, protect skin against uv light damage, reverse heart damage caused by diabetes, 
            and help with asthma. That's one mighty tree! </p>

            <p>Grapple for Apples! It's a struggle to hold on to this amazing fruit which would explain why it is the 
            fourth most popular fruit in the world! Apples contain vitamin C, B-complex, dietary fiber, phytonutrients, 
            calcium, potassium, and phosphorus. Consuming apples may help to prevent dementia and reduce the risk of
            developing cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. </p>
